# Notes

1. As of Strapi 5.7, once an entry is published via API, it's not possible to
   unpublish it via API:

   - Passing `status` param in `PUT /api/*?status=draft`
     does not unpublish entry (it modifies draft entry, and it keeps the previously
     published as it is)
   - Passing `publishedAt: null` in `PUT /api/*` body does
     not unpublish entry (it still publish entry actually)
